# sample_website
A sample website for Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous.
This is the first markdown file about README.md that I write here in Github since I learn coding. 
And this file is about the related <strong>instructions</strong> and <strong>definitions</strong> about this repository. 
So I'm not writing a <em>specific explanation</em>, just type some words here.
